# Patatap Clone

This is a [Patatap](http://www.patatap.com/) inspired website. See it in action [here](https://nikantic.github.io/PatatapClone/)! 

Press any key to make noise and trigger different sounds, circles and colors.

This is another fun project I did as a part of [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).
